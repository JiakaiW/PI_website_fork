        <h1>Highly Stable CNOT Gate for Fluxonium Qubits</h1>

    <p>My research focuses on developing  gates for quantum information processing using fluxonium qubits. 
        We have achieved a gate fidelity exceeding 99.9% and demonstrated stability for 24 days run without any need for recalibration. 
        This exceptional stability indicates minimal decoherence-related errors during gate operations, which is crucial for 
        building more reliable and scalable quantum circuits.</p>
